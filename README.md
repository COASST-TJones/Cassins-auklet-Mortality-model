# Cassins-auklet-Mortality-model
This repo contains files for a Bayesian model estimating total mortality during the Cassins's auklet mortality event in 2014. Upcoming publication.

This model follows the same format as that in Jones et al. (2017) Mass mortality of marine birds in the Northeast Pacific caused by Akashiwo sanguinea. Marine Ecology Progress Series.

The main new addition is incorporation of beaching directly into the model framework
